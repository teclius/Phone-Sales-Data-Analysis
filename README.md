#     Introduction

In today's data-driven world, businesses often rely on data analysis to make informed decisions. This project aims to analyze a comprehensive dataset comprising 10,000 records related to various phone types, their sales, and associated discounts. By examining this data, i seek to uncover patterns and insights that can help inform marketing strategies, pricing decisions, and inventory management.

#     Dataset Overview 
The dataset includes the following columns: 
1. Date: The date when the transaction occurred.
2. FullName: Customer's name.
4. Items: The type of phone associated with the transaction (e.g., iPhone, Samsung Galaxy).
5. Price: The price of the item.
6. Quantity: The number of items sold in the transaction.
7. Discount: The discount applied to the item in percentage.
8. TotalPrice: The total price i calculated after applying the discount.
9. FinalPrice: The final price after i included a fixed tax rate of 10%.
10. OriginalTotalPrice: The total price before i applyied any discounts.


#     Objectives

My primary objectives of this analysis are: 
1. To understand the distribution of prices and discounts across different phone types.
2. To identify the average and total sales values for each phone type.
3. To examine the relationship between quantity sold and total price.
4. To visualize the data and make the insights more accessible and actionable.

#     Methodology

Data Generation: 
I synthetically generated the data using Faker library to create realistic, random data points for each column, aside the calculated columns. 

#     Overview of the data generation process: 
Dates: I generated random dates within a specified range.
Items: I randomly assigned a predefined list of popular phone types.
Prices, Quantities, Discounts: I randomly assigned values within specified ranges.

#     Data Analysis and Visualizations

I created several visualizations to explore and present the data effectively:
1. Distribution of Prices: A histogram showing the frequency of different price values in the dataset.
2. Quantity vs. TotalPrice Scatter Plot: Here i have scatter plot illustrating the relationship between the quantity of items sold and the total price.
3. Discount Distribution by Item(PhoneName): I plot a box plot comparing discount distributions across different phone types.
4. Count of Items Sold by Phone Name: A count plot illustrating the number of items sold for each phone type.

# Conclusion
Through this analysis, i aim to derive actionable insights that can help in optimizing pricing strategies, improving sales tactics, and understanding customer preferences. The visualizations provide a clear and concise way to interpret the data, highlighting key trends. 

I used this project to exemplifies the power of data analysis in making informed business decisions and underscoring the importance of comprehensive data exploration.
